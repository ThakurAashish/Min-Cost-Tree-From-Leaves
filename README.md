# Min-Cost-Tree-From-Leaves
The algorithm uses a monotonic decreasing stack to ensure that smaller values are combined first, which minimizes the multiplication cost. While traversing the array, elements are popped from the stack when a larger value appears, and the cost is calculated using the product of the popped value and the minimum of its neighboring values
